Firstly, the house is located within the Ames city limits, specifically in the NoRidge neighborhood, which contributes significantly to the price. The above-ground living area is 2,198 square feet, adding a substantial amount to the predicted price. Additionally, the second floor has 1,053 square feet, which also positively impacts the price. The overall material and finish of the house are rated at 8 out of 10, indicating high quality, which further increases the price.
