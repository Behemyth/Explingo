The model predicted a lower value for the house based on the above-grade living area square feet and the overall material and finish rating. It also considered the absence of a second floor and the location in Edwards within Ames city limits. However, the presence of a wood deck area of 736 square feet contributed positively to the prediction.
The model predicted a lower value for the house based on features such as a smaller above grade living area square footage, a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house, no second floor square footage, the house being located in the Edwards area within Ames city limits, and a smaller wood deck area in square feet. These features contributed to the predicted value being lower by the respective amounts mentioned in the explanation.
The model's prediction is influenced by different features of the house. For example, having a larger above grade living area square feet tends to decrease the predicted value significantly. Similarly, a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house also decreases the prediction. On the other hand, having a wood deck area in square feet increases the predicted value. The specific values of these features in your case have led to the final prediction made by the model.
The model's prediction for the house is influenced by different features. For example, having a larger above-grade living area square footage and a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house contribute negatively to the predicted value. On the other hand, factors like having a wood deck area and being located in the Edwards neighborhood have a positive impact on the prediction. The combination of these features leads to the final predicted value for the house.
The model predicts that the house's value is lower due to the above grade living area square feet being 1256, the overall material and finish rated as 5, and the second floor square feet being 0. However, the model predicts a higher value due to the wood deck area being 736 square feet and the house being located in the Edwards area within Ames city limits.
