The model predicts that a house with above grade living area of 1256 square feet will have a lower price by $12527.46 compared to the average. Similarly, a house with the highest rating for material and finish will have a lower price by $10743.76. Having no second floor square footage contributes to a lower price by $10142.29. Being located in the Edwards neighborhood in Ames decreases the price by $9913.81. On the other hand, having a wood deck area of 736 square feet increases the price by $9846.38.
The model predicts that a house with above grade living area of 1256 square feet would decrease the predicted price by $12527.46 compared to the average. A house with the highest rating for material and finish would decrease the predicted price by $10743.76. Having no second floor square footage would decrease the predicted price by $10142.29. Being located in the Edwards area in Ames would decrease the predicted price by $9913.81. Lastly, having a wood deck area of 736 square feet would increase the predicted price by $9846.38.
The model predicted that a house with 1256 square feet above grade living area would have a decrease in value of $12,527 compared to the average. A house with a rating of 5 for overall material and finish would have a decrease in value of $10,743. Having no second floor square footage would result in a decrease in value of $10,142. Being located in the Edwards neighborhood within Ames city limits would lead to a decrease in value of $9,914. However, having a wood deck area of 736 square feet would increase the value by $9,846.
The model indicates that a larger above grade living area square feet tends to lower the predicted house price significantly by $12,527.46. Similarly, a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house leads to a decrease in the predicted price by $10,743.76. Having a second floor square footage of 0 also results in a decrease of $10,142.29. If the house is located in the Edwards area within Ames city limits, the predicted price decreases by $9,913.81. Conversely, a larger wood deck area in square feet, such as 736, tends to increase the predicted price
The model predicts that a house's living area square feet being 1256 has a negative impact of -12527.46 on the prediction. Similarly, a high rating for the overall material and finish of the house (rated 5) has a negative impact of -10743.76. Having no second floor square feet has a negative impact of -10142.29. If the house is located in the Edwards area within Ames city limits, it has a negative impact of -9913.81. Conversely, having a wood deck area of 736 square feet has a positive impact of 9846.38 on the prediction.
