The model predicts that a house with a living area of 1256 square feet above grade would have a decrease in price by $12527.46 compared to the average living area size of 1684.9 square feet. A house rated 5 for overall material and finish is predicted to decrease in price by $10743.76 compared to the average rating of 6.7. A house without a second floor is expected to decrease in price by $10142.29 compared to the average second floor size of 583 square feet. A house located in the Edwards neighborhood is predicted to decrease in price by $9913.
The model predicted a lower housing price due to the above grade living area square feet being 1256, the overall material and finish rating being 5, and the second floor square feet being 0. However, the model predicted a higher price because of the wood deck area being 736 square feet. The physical location within Ames city limits being Edwards also contributed to the lower predicted price.
The model's prediction is based on the features of the house. A larger above grade living area square footage has a negative impact on the predicted price, while a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house also has a negative influence. The absence of a second floor and the location being in Edwards within Ames city limits contribute negatively to the prediction as well. Conversely, having a larger wood deck area in square feet has a positive impact on the predicted price.
The model's prediction is based on different features of the house. For example, having a larger above grade living area square feet tends to decrease the predicted value significantly. Similarly, a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house leads to a decrease in the predicted value. On the other hand, having a larger wood deck area in square feet tends to increase the predicted value. The model considers these features along with their respective contributions to make its prediction.
The model predicted a lower house price due to having a smaller above grade living area square footage compared to the average, a higher rating for the overall material and finish of the house, no second floor square footage, and being located in the Edwards area within Ames city limits. Conversely, having a larger wood deck area than the average contributed positively to the predicted house price.
